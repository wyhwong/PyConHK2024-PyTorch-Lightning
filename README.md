## Abstract of Talk

With the rapid advancement in deep learning, models become super large and consume significant resources, making efficiency and simplicity more critical than ever. In this talk, we introduce PyTorch Lightning, a deep learning framework that emerges as a powerful tool that streamlines the process of building, training, and scaling models, allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on what truly matters: innovation.

We will begin with an overview of PyTorch Lightning, discussing the key benefits it offers over traditional PyTorch. We will explore how PyTorch Lightning abstracts away the boilerplate code associated with model training, making it easier to implement and experiment with complex models. Then, we walk through the process of training a ResNet in PyTorch Lightning for image classification task and explore some advanced features in PyTorch Lightning.
